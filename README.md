# conflu-py
Set of scripts for working with confluence using python

# Script to copy the folder structure and files on your computer to confluence pages

Each folder is created as a new page on confluence, hierarchy maintained by parent - child structure

Error checking is currently not implemented

Depends on user to fill in the following details accurately

1. Location of the folder to be copied on the computer

2. Correct Confluence parameters for url, user id , password, spacekey

3. Ensuring the correct parent folder name is provided under which the pages will be created

4. Since confluence does not allow duplicate page names, please ensure that the folders that need to be copied do not have the same names
